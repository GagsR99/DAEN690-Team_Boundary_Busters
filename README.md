# Satellite Image Field Boundary Identification (FBI) and Field Acreage Calculation (FAC) Using Computer Vision

## Project Overview

The "Satellite Image Field Boundary Identification and Acreage Calculation" project aims to utilize computer vision and machine learning techniques to define field boundaries and determine field sizes using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In collaboration with GMU's CATSR and AgGenius Inc., the capstone project employs Sentinel-2's multispectral data to enhance models for higher-resolution drone imagery. The initiative addresses agricultural forecasting challenges by providing accurate boundary detection and acreage measurement, generating a working prototype and open-source code.

## Objective

1. Identify Field Boundaries in Sentinel 2 data.
2. Calculate field acreage using the boundaries above.

## Dataset

- Sentinel-2 Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, available through AWS S3 - (https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs/)

- **Sponsor:** Center for Air Transportation Systems Research - George Mason University
